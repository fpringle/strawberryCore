# To-do list
- generate checking moves
- undo a move (unMove in action.h)
- Function comments to explain parameters
- better variable names
- test suite with check-in-x challenges etc
- SAN output
- value types could be 16-bit instead of 32-bit
- GUI
- make pawns better in middle during opening
- config file
- cutoff iterative deepening if two consecutive iterations produce the same move?
