# To-do list
- generate checking moves
- undo a move (unMove in action.h)
- change bitboard definition to uint64_t for portability
- Override operator<< for board and move
- Maybe implement move_t as an alias for uint16_t?
- Function comments to explain parameters
- Remove unnecessary std::couts for multi-line printing
- Fix indentation
- Get rid of tmp and ray_bb in init_rays()
