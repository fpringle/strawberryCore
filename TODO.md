# To-do list
- generate checking moves
- undo a move (unMove in action.h)
- Function comments to explain parameters
- better variable names
- test suite with check-in-x challenges etc
- SAN output post-move
- value types could be 16-bit instead of 32-bit
- make pawns better in middle during opening
- config file
- consistent naming convention
- utility functions for common operations (e.g. get moving piece,
  iterate through bits set using macros, other side)
